# System Limitations

## Policy Scope Limitation
This system operates strictly under FDIC RMS Manual Section 3.2 (Loans).
Inputs related to other regulatory sections or external laws are considered out of scope.

---

## No Decision-Making Authority
The system does not:
- Approve or reject loans
- Recommend pricing, terms, or corrective actions
- Provide legal, compliance, or supervisory advice

Outputs are observational and descriptive only.

---

## Dependency on Input Quality
The system does not infer missing facts.
If critical information is not provided in the input,
the system will explicitly indicate insufficient policy guidance.

---

## Policy Text Dependency
All outputs are constrained by the provided policy text.
If a topic is not addressed within the supplied Section 3.2 text,
the system will not generate speculative analysis.

---

## Model Limitations
Despite strong prompt constraints, the system relies on a general-purpose
language model and may still require human review for regulatory use.

This tool is intended as an analytical aid, not a substitute for examiner judgment.
