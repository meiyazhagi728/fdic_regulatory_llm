FDIC RISK MANAGEMENT MANUAL OF EXAMINATION POLICIES - SECTION 3.2 (LOANS)
EXPANDED KNOWLEDGE BASE

1. INTRODUCTION AND SAFETY STANDARDS
Section 39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) requires federal banking agencies to establish safety and soundness standards for insured depository institutions. These standards address asset quality, earnings, stock valuation, and internal controls. The "Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness" (Appendix A to Part 364) specifically dictate that institutions must identify, measure, monitor, and control credit risk.

The loan portfolio typically represents the largest asset class and the most significant source of risk to a bank’s capital. Consequently, the examiner’s evaluation of the loan portfolio—including lending policies, credit administration, and the quality of individual loans—is the most critical aspect of the examination process. This evaluation directly determines the "Asset Quality" component of the CAMELS rating.

2. LOAN ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNANCE

Lending Policy Requirements
The board of directors is ultimately responsible for the institution's lending function. They must formulate, approve, and review (at least annually) a written lending policy. This policy acts as the governing document for all credit activities and must clearly address:
- The trade area and acceptable types of loans.
- Lending authority limits for specific officers and committees.
- Guidelines for unsecured loans and portfolio diversification.
- Interest rate policies and repayment terms.
- Limitations on Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios.
- Guidelines for obtaining and reviewing real estate appraisals.
- Environmental risk management.

Loan Review Systems
Every institution must maintain an effective internal loan review system. The primary objective is to promptly identify loans with well-defined credit weaknesses so that timely action can be taken to minimize loss.
- Independence: To ensure objectivity, loan review personnel should be independent of the lending function.
- Scope: The system must validate the accuracy of internal risk ratings (grades) assigned by loan officers.
- Reporting: Findings, including a list of identified deficiencies and required corrective actions, must be reported directly to the board of directors or a board committee.

Credit Grading Systems
An accurate grading system is the foundation of portfolio management. It should capture the risk of every loan and reconcile with regulatory classification definitions (Pass, Special Mention, Substandard, Doubtful, Loss). This grading drives the determination of the Allowance for Credit Losses.

3. ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES (ALLL / ACL)
Institutions must maintain a reserve sufficient to absorb estimated credit losses associated with the loan and lease portfolio.

Methodologies:
- Incurred Loss (ALLL): Historically used model where losses are recognized when they are probable and reasonably estimable.
- Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL / ACL): Under ASC 326, institutions estimate losses over the contractual life of the asset. This requires forecasting based on historical data, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts.

Responsibility:
Management must evaluate the adequacy of the allowance at least quarterly. The analysis should document factors such as historical loss rates, changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio, the volume of past-due and nonaccrual loans, and current economic indicators.

4. COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL (C&I) LOANS

Working Capital Loans
These are short-term extensions of credit designed to finance seasonal business needs, such as the purchase of inventory or the carrying of accounts receivable. Repayment is expected to come from the conversion of these current assets into cash (the operating cycle).

Term Loans
Term loans have maturities exceeding one year and are typically used to acquire capital assets (machinery, equipment, plant expansion). Because the repayment horizon is longer, these loans carry higher risk and require strong cash flow analysis to ensure the borrower can service the debt while maintaining operations.

Accounts Receivable Financing
This is a specialized form of lending where the borrower assigns their interest in accounts receivable to the lender as collateral. It is high-risk and requires strict controls:
- Blanket Assignment: The borrower periodically reports the total amount of receivables.
- Ledgering: The lender receives duplicate invoices and maintains a specific account for the borrower.
- Lockbox: A control mechanism where customer payments are mailed directly to a P.O. Box controlled by the bank to prevent the borrower from diverting funds.

Floor Plan Lending
Used to finance inventory for retailers (e.g., automobile, boat, or appliance dealers). The bank pays the manufacturer, and the dealer repays the bank when the item is sold. The primary risk is "Sold Out of Trust," where the dealer sells the collateral but does not remit the proceeds to the bank. Frequent, surprise floor check inspections are mandatory.

5. LEVERAGED LENDING
Leveraged lending involves loans to borrowers with a high degree of financial leverage (debt) relative to their earnings (EBITDA). These transactions are often used for buyouts, acquisitions, or capital distributions.

Key Definitions:
- Leverage Ratio: Commonly defined as Total Debt divided by EBITDA exceeding 4.0X, or Senior Debt divided by EBITDA exceeding 3.0X.
- De-Leveraging: The borrower's ability to repay debt from free cash flow. A common standard is the ability to repay 50% of total debt within 5-7 years.

Enterprise Value (EV)
In leveraged lending, the secondary source of repayment is often the value of the business itself (Enterprise Value) rather than specific hard assets. Banks must rely on independent, well-documented valuations and stress-test the EV. If a borrower cannot de-lever and the loan relies solely on refinancing, the debt is often classified.

6. OIL AND GAS (O&G) LENDING
O&G lending is a complex sector where repayment relies on the cash flow from extracting underground reserves.

Reserve-Based Lending (RBL)
Loans are secured by "Proved Reserves."
- Proved Developed Producing (PDP): Reserves currently being extracted. These are the most valuable (90% certainty of recovery).
- Proved Developed Non-Producing (PDNP): Reserves behind pipe or shut-in.
- Proved Undeveloped (PUD): Reserves requiring significant capital investment to extract.

Borrowing Base
The loan limit is determined by a "Borrowing Base," calculated as a percentage (e.g., 50-65%) of the Present Value of Future Net Revenue (PV-10).
- Price Decks: Banks must use realistic, standard commodity price forecasts ("price decks") to value the reserves, rather than relying solely on current market spot prices.
- Classification: Portions of the loan exceeding 65% of the risk-adjusted value of PDP reserves are typically classified as Substandard or worse.

7. REAL ESTATE LENDING

Regulatory Limits (Supervisory LTVs)
Part 365 requires adherence to Loan-to-Value (LTV) limits:
- Raw Land: 65%
- Land Development: 75%
- Commercial Construction: 80%
- Residential Construction: 85%
- Improved Commercial Property: 85%
- Owner-Occupied 1-to-4 Family: No specific regulatory limit, though loans >90% LTV should have mortgage insurance.

Construction Lending
Construction loans are considered higher risk. Controls must include "controlled disbursement," where funds are only released after an inspection verifies that work has been completed. Repayment usually comes from a "take-out" loan (permanent financing) or the sale of the project.

Appraisals (Title XI of FIRREA)
- Thresholds: Independent appraisals are required for commercial transactions over $500,000 and residential transactions over $400,000.
- Independence: The appraiser must be engaged directly by the institution, not the borrower.
- Evaluations: For transactions below the thresholds or secured by an "abundance of caution," a less formal "evaluation" of market value is permitted.

8. AGRICULTURAL LENDING
Agricultural loans fund crop/livestock production or land purchases.
- Production Loans: Short-term credits for seed, fertilizer, and fuel, repaid by the annual harvest.
- Carryover Debt: A critical risk indicator. This refers to production debt that was not paid off at the end of the season due to poor yields or prices and is restructured into term debt.
- Livestock Loans: Secured by feeder or breeder livestock. Requires strict inspection and control over sales proceeds.

Classification Exemption: Loans secured by agricultural commodities (grain, livestock) are generally NOT classified if the collateral is secure, marketable, and under the institution's control (inspected within the last 90 days).

9. LOAN CLASSIFICATION DEFINITIONS

- Pass: The asset is sound and has no significant deficiencies.
- Special Mention: The asset has potential weaknesses that deserve management's close attention. If left uncorrected, these may result in deterioration. This is NOT an adverse classification.
- Substandard: The asset is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or collateral. There is a distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if deficiencies are not corrected.
- Doubtful: All weaknesses of Substandard are present, with the added characteristic that collection in full is highly questionable and improbable.
- Loss: The asset is considered uncollectible and of such little value that its continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted. It must be charged off.

10. NONACCRUAL AND CHARGE-OFF STANDARDS

Nonaccrual Status
Banks must generally discontinue the accrual of interest when a loan is 90 days past due on principal or interest.
Exception: Interest may continue to accrue if the asset is BOTH:
1. Well Secured: Collateral value is sufficient to discharge the debt in full.
2. In Process of Collection: Legal action or other collection efforts are proceeding in due course.

Retail (Consumer) Charge-Off Policies
- Closed-End Installment Loans: Charge-off at 120 days past due.
- Open-End Credits (Credit Cards): Charge-off at 180 days past due.
- Residential Mortgages: If LTV > 60%, classify Substandard at 90 days past due. If LTV < 60%, classification may be deferred.
- Bankruptcy: Retail loans should generally be charged off within 60 days of receiving a bankruptcy notice.

11. TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURING (TDR)
A TDR occurs when an institution, for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower’s financial difficulties, grants a concession it would not otherwise consider.
- Concessions: Reduction of interest rate, extension of maturity dates, forgiveness of principal or accrued interest.
- Impairment: TDRs are impaired loans. The allowance for these loans must be calculated based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate.
- A/B Note Structure: A TDR may involve splitting the debt into "Note A" (performing debt at market terms) and "Note B" (charged-off or non-performing debt).

12. SPECIALIZED RISKS AND CONCEPTS

Environmental Risk
Under CERCLA (Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act), banks can be held liable for environmental cleanup costs on foreclosed property. Banks must conduct an "Environmental Risk Assessment" (starting with a Phase I audit) before foreclosing on non-residential real estate.

Loan Participations
When a bank buys a participation in a loan originated by another bank (the Lead Bank), the buying bank must perform its own independent credit analysis. It cannot rely solely on the Lead Bank's assessment.

Concentrations of Credit
A concentration exists when direct, indirect, or contingent obligations exceeding 25% of the bank's Tier 1 Capital plus ALLL are advanced to a single borrower, a related group of borrowers, or a specific industry/sector. Concentrations require higher capital levels and enhanced monitoring.

Bankruptcy Types
- Chapter 7: Liquidation of the borrower's assets to pay creditors.
- Chapter 11: Business reorganization allowing the company to continue operations.
- Chapter 13: Wage earner plan for individuals to adjust debts.
- Automatic Stay: A legal provision that halts all collection activities immediately upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition."""
